            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, my name is Harry Cunningham and I am <span id="age-container">0</span> years old.
              I am a student at Brighton University studing 'Computer Science BSc (Hons)' with the aim to get 
              a first degree. I previously went to The Henley College to complete my A-Levels where I studied computer 
              science, mathematics and economics. While studying I was playing rugby as the captain of the rugby team 
              which allowed me to gain excellent time management skills as well as leadership skills that have become 
              invaluable to me since.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have work experience in two sectors. The first is working at <a href="https://www.badgemorepark.com/">Badgemore park golf club</a>
                This has been my job since June 2021. I have been working in the front of house role that has taught me the importance 
                of customer satisfaction, have trained and supervised new front-of-house team members to ensure that all customer service 
                standards were met. This was useful training in my personal development as it allowed me to improve my communication skills
                and also to work well under pressure. 
                The second is working with a member of the golf club on a website and database for hundreds of golfers that gets used on major 
                competiton days. My role was to work alongside the man who created the whole wesbite and database and imrpove the functionality 
                of the website on mobile devices so that it can improve the user experience on competition days. As the website was originally 
                designed to be used on a laptop that on phones it became very slow as everyone was accessing the site to view results so I needed 
                to improve the efficency of the site to allow for better user experience. I had to meet requirements of user needs and requirements 
                for visual wants as well adding features that has increased the functionality of the mobile version of the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time I am currently completing courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a>
                which has been one of the best decisions I have made. It has allowed me to progress further with my coding then I 
                ever believed possible, as well as guiding me to create projects that are available below to be seen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of programming I am a very active person who goes to the gym 6 days a week so improve my physical health as 
                well an avid golfer. My handicap is currently 20.0 which I am working on lowing as I have been working on my putting skills 
                continuously, as well as my ball stirking so that I have consistent flight of the ball.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fun fact! I've been programing for
              <span id="time-container">0</span> Minutes!
