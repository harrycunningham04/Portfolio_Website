# Portfolio_Website
This is my own website where I can share projects that I have built, a little bit about myself and my education.
My aim is to create a simple website that has a couple pages: home page, project page, about me page and a contact page.
Home page is an overview that has a brief description and links all the pages together easily
Project page goes into detail showing some projects that I have created showcasing my ability in coding
About Me page will allow me to display my education as well a little about me and my passions
Contact Page is so that people have the opportunity to contact me for any enquiries.
Hope you like my work :)
